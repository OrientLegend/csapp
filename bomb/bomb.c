 * Here I will record the phases
 * 1. Border relations with Canada have never been better.
 * 2. 1 2 4 8 16 32
 * 3. (Here are some of the correct answers) 0 207 , 1 311, 2 707, 3 256, 4 389 
 * 4. 7 0 and so on, such as 1 0, 3 0 etc.
 * 5. f-9 l-15 y-14 e-6 r-7 s-8
 *    So final answer is IONEFG or ionefg
 *    One thing that must be obeyed is that the low four bits of every character
 *       should be 9,15,14,6,7,8 successively.
 * 6. (I can't solve this problem, so I turn to the Internet)
